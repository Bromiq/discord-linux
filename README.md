Discord-Linux is a wrapper for [DiscordApp](http://discordapp.com/). This was made for those who would like to run Discord under it's own program on Linux. There are two different flavours of Discord-Linux; x86 (32bit) and x64 (64bit).

At the moment it is in a very simple state and will be updated frequently. If you find any issues, write it up in the issues tab and I'll see what I can do.

## Changelog
- Added a tray icon with menu, which can be accessed by right clicking.
- Added Minimize to taskbar option. Default to off. You can change this in the tray icon menu if you wish.
- Added the ability to refresh Discord, whether it be from the tray or by pressing "CTRL+R" in the window.
- Links no longer open mini Discord windows, and open up the users default web browser.
- Window size, state, and position are now saved, and will be set to how you had it from your last session.
- Moved from Node-Webkit to Electron api. Stability improves!
