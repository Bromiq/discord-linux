Discord-Linux is a wrapper for [DiscordApp](http://discordapp.com/). This was made for those who would like to run Discord under it's own program on Linux. There are two different flavours of Discord-Linux; x86 (32bit) and x64 (64bit).

At the moment it is in a very simple state and will be updated frequently. If you find any issues, write it up in the issues tab and I'll see what I can do.

## FAQ

Q : Why am I not getting notices from mentions, messages, etc?

A : **Make sure you check your settings and enable notices. Most of the time, on first startup, notices are turned off by default.**

Q : How come Push to Talk doesn't work?

A : **Unfortunately, Discord-Linux isn't as full featured as official clients, which means it will mostly act like the web version of Discord. So that means no full Push to Talk support. YET. I have been working on ways to implement full PTT support. Stay tuned for updates on this.**

Q : How do I make / enable custom themes?

A : **Few things to note about using a Custom CSS.**

**- 1 ) the CSS must use !important on every line.**

**- 2 ) the injected CSS is located in the same dir as the `init.json` (`~/.config/Discord/user.css`) and must be named `user.css`**

**You are able to disable your css theme using the tray icon menu, which now has a toggle option for it.**

##Changelog 0.1-5
Ability to add a custom CSS theme is now possible! Now you can customize Discord to how you would like to see it, whether to have it fit the theme of your desktop, or to make it more translucent. The sky is the limit!

**Few things to note about using a Custom CSS.**
- 1 ) the CSS must use !important on every line.
- 2 ) the injected CSS is located in the same dir as the `init.json` (`~/.config/Discord/user.css`) and must be named `user.css`

You are able to disable your css theme using the tray icon menu, which now has a toggle option for it.

For a starter theme, here is one made by a Discord-Linux user that goes by the name of Tenshin.
