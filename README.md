# Discord-Linux
## A node-webkit wrapper for DiscordApp

Discord-Linux is a nodewebkit wrapper for DiscordApp. This was made for those who would like to run Discord under it's own program on Linux. There are two different flavours of Discord-Linux; x86 (32bit) and x64 (64bit).

At the moment it is in a very simple state and will be updated frequently. If you find any issues, write it up in the issues tab and I'll see what I can do.

- ~~Add a taskbar icon for notices, management, etc~~
- Fix an issue with opening links inside Discord-Linux
