Discord-Linux is a wrapper for [DiscordApp](http://discordapp.com/). This was made for those who would like to run Discord under it's own program on Linux. There are two different flavours of Discord-Linux; x86 (32bit) and x64 (64bit).

At the moment it is in a very simple state and will be updated frequently. If you find any issues, write it up in the issues tab and I'll see what I can do.
